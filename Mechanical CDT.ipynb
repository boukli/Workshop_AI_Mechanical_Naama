      "### Diagnosis:\n",
      "The increasing vibration readings and rising temperature suggest that the centrifugal pump may be experiencing bearing wear or imbalance issues. The elevated temperatures could indicate increased friction within the bearings, which is often associated with wear or misalignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prediction:\n",
      "If this trend continues, there is a high risk of premature failure in the next 48-72 hours. Continued wear on the bearings will lead to higher temperatures and potentially catastrophic failure if not addressed promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendation:\n",
      "1. **Immediate Inspection:** Conduct an immediate visual inspection of the pump's alignment and bearing condition.\n",
      "2. **Vibration Analysis:** Perform a detailed vibration analysis to identify specific fault frequencies that may indicate the type and location of the issue (e.g., misalignment, bearing wear).\n",
      "3. **Temperature Monitoring:** Continue monitoring temperature readings closely and consider installing additional sensors if necessary.\n",
      "4. **Preventive Maintenance:** If signs of wear are confirmed, schedule an emergency shutdown for repair or replacement of the bearings.\n",
      "5. **Root Cause Analysis:** After repairs, perform a root cause analysis to understand why this issue occurred and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these steps promptly, you can mitigate the risk of pump failure and ensure continued reliable operation.\n"
